	<div class="menu-heading">A random number of large asteroids will appear (between 2 and 5 each level). When these asteroids are destroyed, they will split into 3 smaller asteroids, which, when shot, will split into 4 smaller asteroids. There are two UFOs which will appear randomly, so make sure to get those before your opponents do! This game is multiplayer, so bring some friends and start crushing</div>
